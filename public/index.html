									<h2 class="major">Home and Early Family</h2>
									<p>Shakespeare was the first of the children of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden to live past a year, and he would have 5 surviving siblings (although one died at 8 years).

While no records of Shakespeare’s education have survived, it is presumed that he attended King Edward VI School in Stratford upon Avon.  He was educated in grammar, as math and science knowledge was limited.
 
It is presumed that he had to leave school at 13 to help his family’s financial situation.  While the Shakespeares had been financially well off, they landed in debt for unknown reasons.  It was serious enough that it prompted John Shakespeare to mortgage his wife’s inheritance.

									<p><strong>It is a common misconception that the Shakespeares were not well off.  In fact, Mary Arden was the daughter of a wealthy landowner, and John Shakespeare made a good living as a glover and trader of produce.  His father even held a position as the equivalent of the mayor of the town (called a high bailiff) in 1569, when Shakespeare was 6 years old.</strong></p>

									<p><strong>MShakespeare married his wife, Anne Hathaway at 18.  This was considered a shotgun wedding as their first daughter Susanna was born 6 months later. 

A day before official records of marriage to Anne Hathaway, there was a license announcing his marriage to “Anne Whately.” The theories on this wrong name range from being a clerical error, to Shakespeare’s intent to marry another, but being forced to marry Anne Hathaway because he had gotten her pregnant.

									<h2 class="major">Marriage</h2>
									<p><strong>There are few records as to how happy Shakespeare was with his wife.  It is often noted that when he moved to London to pursue his career in the city, his wife and children stayed in his home in Stratford in lieu of accompanying him.  We also have the text of his will bequeathing Anne only his second best bed.  Leaving a bed in the will was not odd at the time, as the “best” bed was a considerable establishment of the estate that goes to the main heir, which was his daughter Susanna.  The second-best bed would likely have been the marital bed, and Shakespeare leaving this for Anne has been interpreted to dozens of different conclusions about the state of their marriage.</strong></p>

									<p><strong>Shakespeare and Anne had three children: Susanna, born possibly out of wedlock, and the twins Hamnet and Judith two years later.  Hamnet would die at the age of 11 of unknown reasons, commonly assumed to be of the plague.  None of Shakespeare’s children had grandchildren, so his direct lineage died out before the end of the 17th century.  It is still possible to claim a relationship to Shakespeare’s sister, however, who has numerous descendants living today.</strong></p>

									<h2 class="major">Authorship of Plays</h2>
									<p>There is speculation that he did not write his own plays…How could he have so much knowledge of courtly life? A popular theory states that Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, could have been the real author behind Shakespeare’s works. However, he died in 1604, before some of Shakespeare’s plays were written. As such, doubts about the authorship of the works can be put to rest, at least for the time being.

									<h2 class="major">New Words</h2>
									<p>Shakespeare is thought to have added hundreds of new words to the English language, but according to research from the University of Newcastle, in Australia, his vocabulary was not any larger than that of other playwrights of his time. The only reason we think so is because much more of his work survives. However, he is still exceptional in the way that he innovatively used the words available to him.

									<p>Contrary to popular belief, not all of Shakespeare’s plays were original. His source material ranged from Plutarch’s Parallel Lives to works written closer to his own time. His ability to portray events in a dramatic fashion is what makes his work great, not necessarily the originality of its plot. In fact, the only four of his plays that research has failed to turn up sources for are The Tempest, The Merry Wives of Windsor, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Love’s Labour’s Lost.
